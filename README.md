# Advanced_programming
Firstly, I implemented the skip-gram model using tensorflow. After which I have converted my dataset to string  
I then changed my data's textual form into a numerical one so that it could be processed using a tensorflow graph. 
After that, I produced batches for my inputs.
Batches and labels that follow I once made tensorflow graphs. For the centerboard's target and the context words, I made two placeholders.
I used stochastic gradient descent for my optimization, after which I determined how similar these little baths were to the other words. 
After that, I began training my model.
Finally, the model was completed. 
I visualized the outcomes.
